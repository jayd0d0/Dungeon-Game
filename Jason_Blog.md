Week 7:
Had a meeting with my partner to discuss the spec and planned for the next week on how we can spread out the work and allocate each other a section.

Week 8:
Plan: 
- To read throughly through the spec and attempt to complete Task 1:

    - I had first looked through the spec and MVP to first understand what I was implementing. I had then looked through the code and tried to understand the given code and the different methods and classes within the code. 
    - Now that I had a good understanding of the dungeon, I had focused on a singular task and went through the code again.
    - I had planned what I needed to change first and than implemented the changes.
    - During this week, I was able to complete Task 1c, 1d which was not what I planned but I had a good idea of what I needed to do for my other section which was Task 1f and 1b.

Week 9: 
Plan:
- To finish off task 1, task 2 and task 3

    - During this week, we were able to quickly finish off our task 1 and then
    we had a meeting of what section we would do, giving me the EnemyGoal task. 
    - First off I had read what I needed to do and planned my implementation in the pair_blog.md
    - I had implented the tests and then the task.
    - Now, we only had the last task left so we decided to split it so that I would do the sunStone and MidnightArmour implementation. 
    - When doing task 2, I was also able to find some inconsistencies within the spec which is task 3 so I was able to complete it concurrently.
