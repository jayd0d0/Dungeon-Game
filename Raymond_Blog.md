Week 7:
    My partner and I planned to meet this week to go over the specifications and assign tasks. Due to a busy schedule, we only started the planning process.

Week 8:

    This week's agenda involved of a group meeting for the Task 1 specifications. My assigned responsibilities involved of Task 1A, 1E, and 1F. The initial phase involved of a  examination of the provided codebase, wherein I thoroughly read through to comprehend the various classes and methods.

    Our plan for the week was outlined in the pair_blog.md, as it included the start of the answers to task1 and where to find them. This document facilitated a seamless implementation process, ensuring a coherent and well-guided approach to the tasks at hand.

    I had made substantial progress in my assigned tasks. As of now, I have successfully completed Task 1E and 1F, with significant headway made in the final stages of Task 1A. 

    The in-depth understanding gained from analyzing the code initially, along with the strategic planning detailed in pair_blog.md, has definitely helped me progress smoothly toward my goals for the week.

Week 9: 

    This week's agenda involved another group meeting to allocate tasks for Task 2. With only one task remaining for Task 1, specifically Task 1A, I swiftly completed it.

    For Task 2, I was assigned the responsibilities of handling Swamptile (Task 2C) and Sceptre and MidnightArmour (Task 2D). Following the spec, I began by planning the design for Sceptre and MidnightArmour within the pair_blog.md. Recognizing the complexity of the Sceptre task, I prioritized its completion and once I was done i was able to start on MidnightArmour.

    In a crunch of time, my partner focused on developing tests for MidnightArmour, allowing for a more efficient implementation on my part. Subsequently, we incorporated links to our merge requests and made final refinements to the pair_blog.md.
